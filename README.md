## Introduction

This project is a simple implementation of the classic Tetris game in C++ using the Windows API for console-based graphics. 
It provides a basic Tetris gaming experience where you can control tetrominos, clear lines, and accumulate points.

Believe it or not, there's even a 'welcome' screen and a 'game over' screen in the game.

## Why Tetris and Console Development?

I want to take a moment to explain why I chose to develop Tetris and why I chose the console environment for this project.

### Exploring the Game Development World

For the past approximately 2 years, I've been developing hyper-casual games using the Unity game engine. During this time, I've enjoyed creating games and exploring the world of game development. However, I've always been curious about what goes on behind the scenes of a game engine.

I wanted to understand the inner workings of game development concepts like input handling, collision detection, and more. This curiosity led me to the decision that before diving deeper into game design and game art, it would be beneficial to create a game from scratch without the assistance of a game engine. Tetris seemed like the perfect choice for this experiment because of its simplicity.

### Choosing the Console Environment

The console provides a unique and minimalistic platform for game development. It allows me to focus on the core mechanics of the game without the need for third-party tools or setups.

By developing Tetris in the console, I aimed to challenge myself and gain a deeper insight into the game development process. It's been an exciting journey, and I hope you enjoy playing this classic game as much as I enjoyed creating it.

Thank you for checking out this project!
